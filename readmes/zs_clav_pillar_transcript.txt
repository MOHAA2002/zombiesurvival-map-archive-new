My second map made in hammer, again for the Zombie Survival gamemode by JetBoom. Features a huge pillar in the middle of a deserted land. The survivors work their way up de pillar, only to find that it's infected with zombies. The best defendable spots are higher up so you'll have to work your way around the zombies to survive! It'll also require teamwork. Lone wolves are dead wolves. Credits to ClavusElite / Joerdgs http://www.clavusstudios.nl
