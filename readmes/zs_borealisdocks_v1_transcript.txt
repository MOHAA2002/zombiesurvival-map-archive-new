This is my second zs map!
I've started workin on it when i finished zs_longway_v2
( http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=35284 )!
This time I used the Half Life 2 Episode 2 Engine so you need the game to see some textures or/and models!

The fps is ok too so zs will be fun on it, really!

Oh and of course thanks to Repoman who gave me the idea to make a map with a lighthouse!

1. This map is NOT Optimized so if you dont have a good computer your fps may drop! Use of this map on your own risk!

2.The work on Borealisdocks version2 has been canceled!
Instead of that i made zs_viruslabs ( http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=62507)
