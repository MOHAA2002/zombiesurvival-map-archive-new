After roughly two weeks of development, and an earlier release at facepunch studios, I decided to release it on the banana, seeing that it has a friendlier community.. Story: A couple of days after the rabid prelude to the zombie-pandemic, you end up in an embassy, after all, it's a sturdy building with walls and gates, easily defended, won't you say? The rain hurls itself towards the windows which are boarded up, you turn again to your cup of coffee and the blood freezes in your vains as you hear the insane cries of the infected over the thunder. Features: + 1 Large hall with lobby. + 6 Other rooms. (A bathroom, office, lobby, restaurant, a kitchen, and a long corridor to link the last three rooms.) + An interesting ventilation system, fully accessible. + A working "soundscape" consisting of the old CCCP anthem, sung by a red army choir. (oh shit, KGB is gonna sue me for piracy ) + Another, secret soundscape. + Those cool swinging doors. + 3 buttons, press them and save your life or find yourself in a really stupid situation. + Soviet propaganda! Yay!
