UPDATE
Hey I just noticed,this pack is huge!Its about as twice the size as PHX final part 1 and 2!
also this is my first pack woohoo!!!

O and here are some map menu icons for some of the ZS maps http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=8434 IMPORTANT this pack that i supplied doesn't have zs_raunchyhouse so in the the link after you download go into the files and delete all the files labelled zs_raunchyhouse ok?(of coarse unless you have it by some other way)
