THIS IS THE OFFICIAL MAP! ALL OTHER ZOMBIES ON A PLANE MAPS ARE NON-OFFICIAL! DO NOT UPLOAD WITHOUT PERMISSION PLEASE!

IT'S ZOMBIES ON A PLANE? NEED I SAY MORE?

Actually yes. Map is barely based of the new A-380. The map is 3 decks, the top two passenger decks, and the bottom is a big cargo deck. Humans spawn on top of deck 1 by the cockpit, and the zombies spawn in the back on deck 2.

This map is designed to be very hard. Expect losing... a lot.
