This is probably my first released map (2004?05?). It was made for the gmod9 zombie survival so it does have NPCs. I've seen several rip-off's of this map including zm_csk_cave and zs_gu_caves.

The game play was pretty unbalanced, and not a great map. Regardless, Garrysmod10 broke several textures (as seen in these pics), and I don't ever recommend playing this map again. It's old and dead.

Special feature: Lava control button, Secret room with an automated grav gun sawing machine. (You used to get the grav gun at 100 kills in zombie survival)
